Do you want to learn how to sew with a sewing machine from scratch? Our lovely Antje is a fashion designer and will show you how to do it properly. We will sew small bags or cushion covers, or other simple projects. The first workshop will be on Sat 14.8. from 11am for approx. 3 hours for a minimum donation of 20EUR (materials included). Pre-registration is binding and required, as the number of places is limited (and all places are already fully booked). Due to the already high demand, more dates will follow from the end of August. Stay tuned! ðŸ™‚
PS: The workshop will be held in German, basic German skills are advisable.

Small xHain update:
It's been quiet at xHain for a long time.... In April 2020 we started our [Masken.Berlin](https://www.masken.berlin) portal and sewed masks until our fingers hurt. In the process, we got to know the lovely Antje, who designed our mask pattern back then. From many people (mainly cis-male, unfortunately) we heard sentences like "I would love to help, but unfortunately I can't sew!" We thought that was a shame, but at the time we didn't have the time to do anything about it. We are doing something about it now, because we have learned that being able to sew is not only useful in everyday life, but can even help save lives.

After the Covid19 summer break in 2020, xHain went into a rebuilding lockdown for 7 months in autumn. The rebuild is not yet complete, but thanks to a major funding in December 2020, we have acquired many new pieces of equipment, including a new sewing machine, overlock machine and embroidery machine. While we have been in the process of expanding new work areas for many months now, including our sewing corner, our open evenings are once again taking place outside the door on Mondays. xHain has become Jugend Hackt:Lab Berlin and offers various online and offline formats for kids since April 2021. We think it's about time that workshops for adults are offered again. Of course only outside in front of xHain, for inside the 3 G's (fully vaccinated, cured or tested) and our [hygiene concept](https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/hygiene-konzept) still applies.
